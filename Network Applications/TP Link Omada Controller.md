Create a new Debian LXC, then open the Terminal for it.

Start by installing Java8 and MongoDB v<4, as prerequisites:

	apt install gnupg
	apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 8AC3B29174885C03
	add-apt-repository --yes https://adoptopenjdk.jfrog.io/adoptopenjdk/deb/

If you get an error, run: apt-get install software-properties-common then try again

	apt update
	apt install adoptopenjdk-8-hotspot
	
To check that you have the right version installed, run:
	
	java -version
	
Should output openJDK version 1.8.X.  If it doesnâ€™t, you probably have another java installed.

	update-alternatives --config java
	
Then download and install mongodb server
	
	wget https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/debian/dists/stretch/mongodb-org/3.6/main/binary-amd64/mongodb-org-server_3.6.23_amd64.deb 
	dpkg -i mongodb-org-server_3.6.23_amd64.deb

Then download and install the Omada SDN Software, substituting the link and version numbers below for the latest values:
	
	wget https://static.tp-link.com/software/2021/202107/20210701/Omada_SDN_Controller_v4.4.3_linux_x64.deb

	dpkg -i Omada_SDN_Controller_v4.4.3_linux_x64.deb

Check for errors, sometimes you need to run:
	
	apt install curl
	apt install jsvc
	apt --fix-broken install

You should get an output that looks like:

	==========================
	Omada Controller will start up with system boot. You can also control it by [/usr/bin/tpeap]. 
	check omada
	Starting Omada Controller. Please wait............................................
	Started successfully.
	You can visit http://localhost:8088 on this host to manage the wireless network.
	========================

Now you can visit the WebUI by going to http://ipaddr:8088

To update Omada controller, first you need to back up your settings.  You can do this via the WebUI, and save it to your computer.

Now, you can start uninstalling using the dpkg -r command (as opposed to the dpkg -i command used to install).

	dpkg -r omada*.deb
	
If you have more than one version of the omada controller .deb, you'll have to be more specific about which one.  I suggest you delete the old one after the new one is confirmed working.

It'll take a minute or two to stop the program, take control, and then start uninstalling.  It'll ask if you want to back up the settings.  I suggest you do so, on top of backing up via WebUI.

Now just start back at the wget command for the new version and "dpkg -i" the newest version.

Once you run the dpkg install command, it should tell you it detected a backup.  Go ahead and hit "yes" to restore from the detected backup.

If it doesn't detect the backup, no problem.  Go ahead and start it up and get to the WebUI and just restore the backup you have on your client machine.
